                            Calvin TODO list

Bugs and documentation
---------------------------------------------
  - Lacking doxygen
      + connection/connection.h
      + common/utils.h
      + common/types.h
      + common/types_test.h
      + common/configuration.h
      + common/atomic.h
      + scheduler/lock_manager.h
      + scheduler/scheduler.h
  - Namespace doxygenation
  - Doxygenation of classes
      + checkpointing/checkpointer.h
      + checkpointing/ping_pong.h
      + applications/microbenchmark/microbenchmark.h
      + common/configuration.h
      + connection/connection.h
      + scheduler/lock_manager.h
      + scheduler/scheduler.h
  - Make LevelDB and checkpointing command line options via calvin_ctl
      + Currently inaccessible
  - Internal loadgen is broken
  - Sequencer currently gets SQL, need it to be parsed/executed by Scheduler
  - stored_procedures folder should really be inside bin/

System Properties that Do Not Exist
-----------------------------------
  - Full TPC-C
  - Failover on the fly
  - Prefetching
  - Arbitrary user-submitted python transaction code
      + Sample banking application in Python
  - (AARON FINAL PROJ) Dependent transactions (transformations on python code)
  - (ANTON/MICHAEL FINAL PROJ) Queries and predicate matching

System Design and Implementation
--------------------------------
  - (ALEX) Re-architect and restructure scheduler/sequencer
  - (ALEX) Data model, key/val types, etc., should be optimized for infrequent copying
    while allowing greater generality. In particular:
      - SSKey-style keys, with explicit path/type/column. This would allow:
          - Multiple locking granularities.
          - System can manage blob vs. columnar storage.
